# Elephants - polish IT olympiad
- This is my solution to a task from polish IT olympiad (in Python) - https://oi.edu.pl/static/attachment/20110704/oi16.pdf - page 71
- The algorithm takes an input from the console (4 lines of integers), and displays the result in the console. Also there is a separate code comparing input and output files for correctness (Slonie_check_results.py).
- I did this exercise about a year ago, but I just copied that to training repository now
